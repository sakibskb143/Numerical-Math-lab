1. Start

2. Input the Augmented Coefficients Matrix (A):
	
	For i = 1 to n
		
		For j = 1 to n+1
			
			Read Ai,j
		
		Next j
	
	Next i

3. Apply Gauss Elimination on Matrix A:
	
	For i = 1 to n-1
		
		If Ai,i = 0
			
			Print "Mathematical Error!"
			Stop
		
		End If
		
		For j = i+1 to n
			
			Ratio = Aj,i/Ai,i
			
			For k = 1 to n+1
				
				Aj,k = Aj,k - Ratio * Ai,k
			
			Next k
		Next j
	Next i

4. Obtaining Solution by Back Substitution:
	
	Xn = An,n+1/An,n
	
	For i = n-1 to 1 (Step: -1)
		
		Xi = Ai,n+1
		
		For j = i+1 to n
			
			Xi = Xi - Ai,j * Xj
		
		Next j
		
		Xi = Xi/Ai,i
	Next i

5. Display Solution:
	
	For i = 1 to n
		
		Print Xi
	
	Next i

6. Stop
